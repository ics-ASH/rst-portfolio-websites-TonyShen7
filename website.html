   <h3 style="color:aquamarine">There are many pathway and job opportunities in the field of computer science like consulting, data processing, engineering, and many more. But the one I think many people including myself are very interested in is video game programming, almost everyone had played some sort of video games before, especially in this ever growing technology era. Many of us starts to develop and wonder how do we creates these video games that we spent various time in.

   <h1 style="color:white">What does a game developer do?ü§î</h1>
   <h3 style="color:aqua">Game developer essentially turns ideas into the virtual world by writing codes from various programming languages, find or create sounds/music for your game, make the models for the characters and the environment, add dialogues if there are any, fix bugs to ensure that the game can run properly. Some of the most commonly used coding languages for video games includes: C++, C#, Java(Minecraft!), and a lot of other languages depending on what type of games you want to create and what program you want to use.</h3>
   <h1 style="color:white">The education required for this job!üìñ</h1>
   <h3 style="color:aqua">For game developer, it depends on whether or not you want to work alone, with a group of friends, or work for a company, if you want to work alone, then there is no education required apart from the need of knowing how to create game, but if you want to work for company, then you should have the following:
<br><br><li>A bachelor's degree in software engineering or in computer science</li>
 </h3>
 <h1 style="color:white">The future of game developerüëÄ</h1>

 <h3 style="color:pink">With the increasing and fast growing of video games, many companies or individuals are competing to create game(s) that attracts as much players as they possibly can, with this, it also come with competition, like hiring more people to increase the speed of game development, but in recent time, since the invention of artificial intelligent, many companies started to cut people, because there are jobs in the game development that doesn't need too much people unlike before since now we have artificial intelligent that can respond to a lot of questions, fast.
<br>In conclusion, game developer are quite a good choice for jobs, but in recent time due to the invention of artificial intelligent, many game developer have lost their jobs because of companies no longer need as much employees, and solo or smaller game studios faces a lot of competition to catch people's eyes. Therefore it is not as good as it was before.  </h3>
