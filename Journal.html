    <h1 style="color:tomato;">Weekly journal&#128512;:
        <h2 style="color:tomato;">Week 1: We did the setups for a lot of the stuff we need, like creating a Github account. We also watched a movie on Thursday
and Friday that was about the history of computer science, and how it was started by Alan Turing. There were also a presentation from Nokia who talked about their summer job, you
get paid, while also getting work experiences and you could add it to your resume.
It sounds awesome until you hear about the accept rate, plenty of people tried to apply, hey only accepted twenty of so students, so the competition is fierce and my chances
are slim.
<br>Week 2: in this week, we mainly focused on learning HTML to create a website, but due to work not able to save on Github, and other problems like two users uses one single
computer, which caused you to see other person's work, Mr.Jamieson spent a few days figuring out the solutions for these problems, by the end of the week, everything is
fixed. I've also learned a lot about HTML using w3school.
<br>Week 3: In this week, we had a presentation from Canada's cyber security department coming in to talk about their job, how is the working environment, what is the tasks
and a lot of different things that are new for me. It was really interesting to hear about how they defend attacks from external threats. Near the end of the week, we also
started to learn about the way of thinking for computer programming, I learned that we should give very specific codes so that the program knows how to perform tasks.<br>
Week 4: In this week, we spent 2-3 days creating a website about people who have made significance history in the field of computer science, you can either do it in a group
of two or work alone, me and Fuxuan teamed up and created a website about Tim Berners-Lee, who is very famous in computer science for many reason including the creator of HTML.
We also worked on the light, changing color, and a lot of coding to change the light.
Week 5: In this week, we spent 1-2 days to continuing on coding light, I learned how to make the light bright, change to other colors, and make the light into certain images.
We've also learned more about javascript, and had a quiz at the end of the week, to test our javascript skills.
Week 6: In this week, it was a 4 day week, we had 3 days to learn Javascript by ourselves since Mr. Jamieson is not here for 3 days on codehs, we would submit our progress each
days.
week 7: This week, we did more coding with the light, and we finished some smaller projects with javascript.
Week 8: This week we made moe progressions with the javascript, every week we have an cse which is learning about how to make your light glows in different ways.
week 9: This week we did a lot of codehs, which was about learning more javascript, we also did cse where we coded more with lights, we also had a little quiz on jvascript.
week 10: This week, we had to do presentation about careers, in programming, i chose video game developer as I think it is really cool, we spent three days on it, and one day on cse,
which is more about coding in python to make light glows differently, the name of the module is called unicornhathd.
week 11: In this week, we did more javascript, precisely javascript unit 2 which was about functions. 
week 12: In this week we did more javascript lessons, as well as cse, just learning more about javascript and unicornhathd coding.
week 13: In this week we did some more project as well as starting unit 3 of javascript which was about the loops, for loops...
week 14: we worked on the unit 3 of javascript all week and we did cse which was finishing the challenges with different lights.
week 15: This week we finished the unit 3 javascript, learned more about different loops and coding in javascript more efficiently.
week 16: In this week we had to team up in a group of 3 for presentation about javascript our group, Alex, Adrian, and me, we chose arrays as our subject, it was the hardest of them all,
but we have full confidence we can explain it to others in a simpler way.
week 17: to be continues 5/17/2024
