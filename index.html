          <h1 style="color:tomato;">Weekly journal&#128512;:
              <h2 style="color:tomato;">Week 1: We did the setups for a lot of the stuff we need, like creating a Github account. We also watched a movie on Thursday
      and Friday that was about the history of computer science, and how it was started by Alan Turing. There were also a presentation from Nokia who talked about their summer job, you
      get paid, while also getting work experiences and you could add it to your resume.
      It sounds awesome until you hear about the accept rate, plenty of people tried to apply, hey only accepted twenty of so students, so the competition is fierce and my chances
      are slim.
      <br>Week 2: in this week, we mainly focused on learning HTML to create a website, but due to work not able to save on Github, and other problems like two users uses one single
      computer, which caused you to see other person's work, Mr.Jamieson spent a few days figuring out the solutions for these problems, by the end of the week, everything is
      fixed. I've also learned a lot about HTML using w3school.</p> </pre>
